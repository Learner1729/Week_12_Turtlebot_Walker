## <a name="overview"></a> Overview
The repository includes a package for turtlebot to implement a simple walker algorithm much like Roomba robot vacuum cleaner. The robot should move forward until it reaches an obstacle but should not collide with it, then the robot will rotate in place until the way ahead is cleared. Once the way is cleared the robot moves forward, and repeat's the same process again when it comes across the obstacle.

## <a name="pre"></a> Prerequisites 

* [ROS Kinetic](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) on Ubuntu 16.04. 
  >Note: Follow the installation steps given on ROS Kinetic installation page.

	After installing the full version of ROS kinetic distro we need to setup ROS by following the below steps. This steps are needed to be performed only once: <br/>
  **1.** Setting up rosdep systemwide: `$ sudo rosdep init` <br/>
	**2.** Setting up rosdep in a user account: `$ rosdep update` <br/>
	**3.** Setting up enivronment variables <br/>
  Updating the bashrc file: `$ echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc` <br/>
  Sourcing the bashrc file: `$ source ~/.bashrc` <br/>

* [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) is a well-developed robust open source physic based simulator which can be used for simulating robotic systems. It can be used along with ROS as well as independently according to the user's need.

* [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) is specifically used for visualization of real & simulated robotic systems.

* [Turtlebot_Gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo) 
  >Note: Gazebo & Rviz will be already installed as part of the ROS distro, however Turtlebot_Gazebo is need to be installed separately.

	To install turtlebot_Gazebo, open a terminal and run the following command: <br/>
  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-gazebo ros-kinetic-turtlebot-apps ros-kinetic-turtlebot-rviz-launchers
  ```
  The developed package also depends on: *roscpp*, *geometry_msgs*, & *sensor_msgs*

## <a name="workspace"></a> Creating a package workspace

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```
Before any update run the command `$ source devel/setup.bash` 

## <a name="implementation"></a> Standard install via command-line

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Learner1729/turtlebot_walker.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
```
>Note: The last command checks whether the environment variable includes the directory you are in or not. If it doesn't include please follow the above steps properly. This is the most important step to check that everything is installed and linked properly. 

## <a name="rosrun"></a> Run Walker using rosrun

After following the above standard install commands, follow the below commands to run turtlebot_gazebo and default world

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
```
You will see a gazebo window open along with default turtlebot_world with obstacles as well as the turtlebot robot. Now, we will run the walker node. Open a new shell and follow the below commands.

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun turtlebot_walker turtlebot_walker_node
```
Now, the turtlebot should start moving forward. As the robot drives and when it encounters an obstacle, it will stop, turn in place to free itself and then continue driving.

>Note: We can add obstacles when the simulation is going on, which can be useful to check whether our code is working properly or not.

## <a name="roslaunch"></a> Run Walker using launch file

The ROS node and turtlebot_gazebo environment can be start using a single launch file as follows:

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot_walker turtlebot_walker_node
```
>Note: No need to start roscore, roslaunch will automatically start if it detects that it is not already running.
